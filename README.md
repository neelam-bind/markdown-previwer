# Markdown Previewer with Syntax Highlighting and Dark Mode

## Overview

This project is a lightweight, web-based Markdown previewer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It converts Markdown input into HTML in real time using [Marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) and applies syntax highlighting to code blocks with [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/). The project also features a dark mode toggle for a more comfortable viewing experience.

## Features

- **üìù Markdown Input Area:**  
  A dedicated textarea on the left-hand side where users can type in Markdown syntax. This allows you to quickly create and edit your Markdown content.

- **üëÄ Live Preview:**  
  A real-time preview section on the right-hand side that instantly displays the formatted output as you type. This makes it easy to see how your Markdown will render.

- **üî§ Basic Markdown Support:**  
  The previewer supports essential Markdown elements, including:
  - **Headings:** Create titles and sections using `#`, `##`, etc.
  - **Bold & Italics:** Format text using `**bold**` and `*italic*`.
  - **Links:** Easily add hyperlinks using `[title](http://example.com)`.
  - **Lists:** Create both ordered and unordered lists for structured content.

- **‚ùå Clear/Reset Button:**  
  A clear button is provided to reset the textarea, allowing you to quickly remove all Markdown input and start fresh.

- **üíª Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting:**  
  - **Inline Code:** Supports inline code snippets, making it easy to highlight short code fragments.
  - **Multi-line Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks (with triple backticks) to include longer code segments.
  - **Syntax Highlighting:** Integrated with Highlight.js to automatically apply language-specific syntax coloring to your code blocks, enhancing readability.
